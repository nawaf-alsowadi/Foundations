Open Systems Interconnection Model is a framework that dictate how devices over the network sends, receive, and interpret data no matter what the device is. 
OSI Model has the following seven layers. At each layer (except for layer 1 which transform data to bits), a new data is added to the data we wish to send by a process called *encapsulation*.   ![[6d17472b87f8792dadde3bb06aa1fdaa.svg]]![[Pasted image 20250707182243.jpg]]
# Physical Layer
It is the lowest layer in the model. Devices use hardware, hardware use electronic signals to transfer data between devices in binary numbering system (1's and 0's).
For example, ethernet cables/ WiFi signals connect devices to each other.![[Pasted image 20250707182015.png]]
0's and 1's can be transferred by using digital signals (NRZ, RZ, Manchester encoding). Typically, up (high voltage) means 1, and down (low voltage) means 0.

## üîå Signal Encoding Methods (with ‚ÄúUp‚Äù and ‚ÄúDown‚Äù)

In signal waves, "up" = high voltage and "down" = low voltage. These are used to represent binary values depending on the **encoding method**.

---

### üî∑ 1. NRZ-L (Non-Return-to-Zero Level)

**L = Level**  
Voltage **level** directly represents the bit.
It can have:

| Bit | Signal Level |
| --- | ------------ |
| 1   | High (‚¨ÜÔ∏è)    |
| 0   | Low (‚¨áÔ∏è)     |
or it can have:

| Bit | Signal Level |
| --- | ------------ |
| 0   | High (‚¨ÜÔ∏è)    |
| 1   | Low (‚¨áÔ∏è)     |
What matters is the consistency!
üß† _Level itself carries information._

---

### üî∑ 2. NRZ-I (Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted)

**I = Inversion**  
Bits are represented by **transitions** or **no transitions**.

|Bit|Signal Behavior|
|---|---|
|1|Invert (flip signal)|
|0|No change|
Basically, when we face 1, change the wave, otherwise, keep the same wave.
üß† _Transition = 1, No transition = 0_

---

### üî∑ 3. Manchester Encoding

Each bit is divided into **two halves**. The **transition in the middle** determines the bit.

| Bit | First Half ‚Üí Second Half       |
| --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Low ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚Üí High ‚¨ÜÔ∏è:              |
| 0   | High ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚Üí Low ‚¨áÔ∏è               |
0:
   __
    | __

1:
    __
   __ |

üß† _Transition direction in the middle tells the value._

---

### üî∑ 4. Differential Manchester Encoding

- Always a **transition in the middle**
- Start of the bit determines the value:

|Bit|Start of Bit|Middle of Bit|
|---|---|---|
|1|No transition|Always transition|
|0|Has transition|Always transition|
The start of the wave determine the bit. If it start the transition immediately => 0, if it start transition in the middle => 1
üß† _Clock sync is easy. Info is in the presence/absence of transition at the start._

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison Table

|Encoding Method|`1`|`0`|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**NRZ-L**|High (‚¨ÜÔ∏è)|Low (‚¨áÔ∏è)|Level-based|
|**NRZ-I**|Transition (Flip)|No transition|Change means 1|
|**Manchester**|Low ‚¨áÔ∏è ‚Üí High ‚¨ÜÔ∏è|High ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚Üí Low ‚¨áÔ∏è|Mid-bit transition always|
|**Diff Manchester**|No transition at start|Transition at start|Mid-bit transition always|

## Data Link Layer
This layer contain the physical addressing including src & dst MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.
MAC addresses comes with all network-enabled devices.
It is specifically inside the Network Interface Card (NIC,  piece of hardware that all networked devices come with) and it is unique and the created by the manufacturer which burned it there and it cannot be changed.
![[ethernet-frame-structure.webp]]
- **Preamble:** Ethernet uses digital encoding where data is transmitted as ***voltage changes (up/down)***. Receiver needs to ***synchronize its clock*** with these changes to interpret bits correctly.
- **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD):** Indicate the actual start of the frame.
- **Destination MAC Address:** Physical address of the receiver.
- **Source MAC Address:** Physical address of the sender.
- **Length/Type:** Either the length of the data field or the protocol type (e.g., IPv4, ARP).
- **Frame Check Sequence (FCS):** Used to detect errors in the packet. If error is happened, packet will be discarded/ a retransmission request is sent to the sender.

## Network Layer
In this layer, the routing of the data we want to send takes place. Routing protocols such as *Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)* and *Routing Information Protocol (RIP)* determine the best optimal path for the data to transmitted.

To decide the best route, it depends on multiple factors:
- Is it the shortest?
- Is it reliable (have packets been lost on that path before)?
- Is it the fastest physical connection? i.e. one path can use fiber (fast) and some others use copper (slow)

In this layer we only use IP addresses, devices such as routers that are capable of delivering the packets are called Layer 3 devices.

#### QoS
8 bits:
- First 6 for Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) for prioritizing the traffic. For example:

|DSCP Value|Binary|Meaning|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|
|`000000`|0|Best Effort|Normal traffic|
|`001010`|10|AF11 (Assured Forwarding)|Low-priority business data|
|`101110`|46|Expedited Forwarding (EF)|Voice over IP (VoIP)|
|`111000`|56|CS7 (Class Selector 7)|Network control (high priority)|

- Last 2 for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) used along with TCP to avoid dropping packets because of network congestion.
	- **Routers** that support ECN can **mark packets** instead of dropping them when the network is congested.
	- The **receiver sees the ECN mark** and tells the **sender (via TCP acknowledgment)**.
	- The **sender slows down** the sending rate to relieve congestion.

| ECN Bits | Meaning                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `00`     | Router in the path is not ECN-Capable |
| `01`     | ECN Capable Transport (ECT(1))        |
| `10`     | ECN Capable Transport (ECT(0))        |
| `11`     | Congestion Encountered (CE)           |
*Note: 01 & 10 are the same.*
